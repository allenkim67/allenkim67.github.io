Hey there! My name is Allen.

I used to be an online poker player, worked as a frontend dev in SF, now I'm in Bangkok spending
most of my time reading and programming.

A big reason for creating this blog was so that I could branch out to the
tech community, so if you're interested in what I'm putting out there feel free to contact me and I'll try to respond to
everyone who does.
