title: Business Growth And Network Effect

Recently I've been interested in how people make money on youtube. I guessed
that it might be a quicker to make money but with a lower earning potential.
But after some research I noticed something interesting. First, I don't think
that growing youtube channel is any faster than growing a startup. Even more
interesting is that I think the growth rate is surprisingly similar. Now my
theory is that user bases tend to grow in a similar way regardless of platform
or product.

And it's not just how long it takes to get to a certain number of users, but
also the shape of the growth. In startups you hear about exponential growth and
hockey stick shaped graphs, but you see the same thing in the growth of youtube
subscribers. New channels can take a year or more getting their first 1000 subs,
but the biggest channels can do it in literally [less than an hour](https://vidstatsx.com/top-100-1h-sub-gains).

If you think about it, it makes sense. Because each member of a network can
bring in multiple new members, networks tend to grow exponentially. And even in
terms of absolute time, there doesn't seem to be that much variance. If you look
at successful youtube channels you'll find that they tend to have hit their
stride in around 1-2 years. For startups it's around [2-3 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3110601).
Perhaps accounting for development time, it's about the same time frame. I think
a possible explanation for this is that because network effects are exponential,
word of mouth dominates other growth factors. And regardless of what the product
is, people tend to share products at roughly the same rate (assuming it's worth
sharing at all).
