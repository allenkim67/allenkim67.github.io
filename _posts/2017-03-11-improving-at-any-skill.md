The way I approach getting good at something is first I'll look into the broad
theory of that skill. For me this usually means getting a book, but I think any
well organized beginner's guide will work. But the idea is that you want to
start with a broad overview so that you know roughly which order to approach
things in and what progress looks like.

Then as soon as possible you want to put theory into practice. I think this is
problem for me because I usually really like reading about theory so it's
important to keep that part short. As soon as you learn something you can put
into practice you should try to do it.

The last part is the reason why you want to get into the practice part quickly.
Because theory can never cover every detail of practice, you'll run into
specific things you don't understand or want to know if more depth. This is
where you review the theory material or do research into a more detailed topic.

So the loop looks roughly like this: theory -> practice -> details.
