title: Let Yourself Try Things More Than Once

Being 30 and looking back, I've realized that there are a lot of things that I
tried to get into, gave up, but it only really stuck when I came back to it
years later. Sometimes I had to come back to it multiple times. For example with
programming I tried it in university and didn't really get it or like it, but
trying it again five years later I loved it. I think it's one part familiarity
and one part coming back to it with a fresh perspective.

That's why I think it's good to have early exposure to things that interest you
and to be willing to try things more than once.
