Video is good when you want to learn how to do something. Books are good when
you want to understand concepts. This is because video is at a lower level of
abstraction. In books you lose details (i.e. higher level of abstraction) which
is good if those details are a distraction but bad if those details can be
important. In many cases the best way is to use both.
