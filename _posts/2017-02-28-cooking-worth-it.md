title: Is Cooking Worth It?
categories: cooking
---

I'm trying to do more cooking, at least once a day, but possibly for the
majority of my meals. I used to think that cooking wasn't really worth it
because it can be pretty time consuming. But lately I've been interested in a
more healthy, less sedentary lifestyle, so I think that's really pushed cooking
into the "worth it" category.

In the past I looked at cooking as a matter of convenience or cost. Because if
you're in a big city you can eat whatever you want, it's just a matter of
whether you're willing to pay someone for the convenience of not having to make
it yourself. If you think of it that way, it doesn't really make sense to do
your own cooking if you could be spending that time increasing your own earning
potential.

But my position has changed in a couple of ways. One is that I think cooking
contributes to a more healthy lifestyle which has benefits that are hard to put
a value on. It makes you less sedentary. It makes you more conscious about
what's actually in your food. And interestingly I think there's even a mental
health aspect to it. Cooking alone can be relaxing in the way that maybe
gardening or jogging or meditation might be relaxing, but in a way that I find
programming isn't. And cooking socially is a great way to bond with friends and
family.
