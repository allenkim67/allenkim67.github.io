title: Sustainability of Programming

These days when I think about the future of my career, I feel more and more that
programming isn't what I want to do forever. Maybe surprisingly a big reason for
that is health. More and more I feel like programming 8 hours a day, 5 days a
week for years on end isn't sustainable. There's a strong argument that it's not
enough to exercise 1 hour a day if you're sitting at a keyboard for 8+ hours a
day. The human body is always adapting so the effects of a healhty or unhealthy
lifestyle are accumulated over time. Now that I'm 30, I'm starting to think more
about how these decisions will affect me when I'm older.

I think the biggest argument for sticking with programming is that it's very
lucrative as a career. Honestly, if I can't figure anything else out and I need
the money I'll be glad I can fall back on programming. But at the same time I
don't think programming is the only path or even the most lucrative path. I
think in trying to create my own startup I can start to see all the different
ways people can add value to a company outside of just programming. Hopefully
in the future I'll be able to hire out the programming work, and I think this
aligns with the path that allows me to have the most impact in the world.
