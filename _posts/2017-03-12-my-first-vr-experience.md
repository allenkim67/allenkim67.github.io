Today my wife and I went to [totalvr](http://www.totalvr.co/) which is a place
in Bangkok where you can rent an HTC Vive setup for an hour. This was basically
the first time we tried VR and it was a ton of fun. We probably played about a
half dozen games. Some titles I remember are Brookhaven, Audio Shield, The Blu,
Knockout League, Space Pirate, and Ultimate Booster. Here are my initial
impressions.

1. I was a little surprised how natural it felt to interact in the virtual
world. So much so it didn't even feel like something I hadn't done before.

2. That said, it was an undeniably more immersive experience. I could feel my
adrenaline after playing Brookhaven.

3. Falling in VR is a super weird sensation. You start to lose sense of
direction and it has a very familiar feeling to actually falling.

4. Headset was heavier than I expected and when the headset isn't aligned just
right, visual focus will blur.

5. Games were on the whole a lot simpler than I expected. Maybe it's because of
the games that were available where I went but I'd say from a gameplay
perspective the games were on the level of your average mobile app rather than
a console or pc game. For example, in Brookhaven, I was surprised that you can't
really move around. You just stand still and shoot at the zombies that
come toward you.

My conclusion with VR is that for various reasons I can understand if people
felt that it was underwhelming, especially as it is now. In some ways VR feels
so natural that it draws you attention to the ways it's not real enough. And
because of all the hype it's received I admit part of me expected more. But it's
clear to me now how new VR still is and how much it's still in the early stages.

But I think VR is the type of thing that feels worse when you don't have it
after you've experienced it, than it feels good having it. Like retina screens
or faster internet. When you didn't have it, it was fine because you didn't know
what you were missing out on. But now you just can't go back. That's the feeling
I have now. And I think that's the feeling everyone else will have eventually.
For example, imagine if you could watch any movie in the theater now in VR
instead. Who could go back to a 2d screen?

Whatever VR's current flaws, it's not something that seems pointless, it just
makes me wish I had more and better VR.
