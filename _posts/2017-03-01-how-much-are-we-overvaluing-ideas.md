title: How Much Are We Overvaluing Ideas?
categories: business
---

I think almost everyone's natural instinct is to overvalue ideas, and undervalue
validating their ideas. It's such a common mistake that these days the most
common startup advice you'll hear is to validate your idea, and that ideas
themselves are worthless.

The thing that's most interesting to me is how easy it is to make this mistake
even when you know you're not supposed to do it. I think this tells us something
interesting about the degree to which are intuitions mislead us. We're not just
overvaluing our idea, we're wildly overvaluing our ideas. We're not just
undervaluing validating our ideas, we're wilding undervaluing it.
